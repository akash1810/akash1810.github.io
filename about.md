Hi, I'm Akash. I'm a Full Stack Software Developer currently working at [The Guardian](http://gu.com).

This is a place for random thoughts, posts and other stuff that I've not yet categorised. I might move over the backlog of posts I've made on Tumblr other places... depends how lazy I'm feeling.


All thoughts are my own.
