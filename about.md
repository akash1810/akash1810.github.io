Hi, I'm Akash. I'm a Full Stack Software Developer currently working at [The Guardian](http://gu.com).

This is a place for random thoughts, posts and other stuff that I've not yet categorised. I might move over the backlog of posts I've made on Tumblr and other places... depends how lazy I'm feeling.

All thoughts and views are my own.

This site was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Type Theme](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme).
